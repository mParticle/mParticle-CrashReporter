# mParticle CrashReporter

This is a fork of [PLCrashReporter](https://www.plcrashreporter.org) compiled and customized to work with the [mParticle Apple SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mParticle-Apple-SDK). The framework is used as an optional dependency (subspec).

## Installation

When using the [mParticle Apple SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mParticle-Apple-SDK) you can choose to include all subspecs

```ruby
pod 'mParticle-Apple-SDK'
```

Or you can pick and choose the configuration. If Crash Reporting is among your choices:

```ruby
pod 'mParticle-Apple-SDK/CrashReporter'
```
